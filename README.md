# MemLuv
An HLS-synthesizable Dynamic Memory Manager for FPGAs

The MemLuv library develops a dynamic memory manager (DMM) for effective resource utilization in many-accelerator architectures targeting to FPGA devices.  The library is developed in C99-complient C language and it is fully synthesizable with the Xilinx Vivado High-Level-Synthesis (HLS) tool, so far.

The library is customizable so that it tradeoffs memory allocation timing overhead and FPGA resources, i.e. FFs, LUTs, DSP48s and BRAMs.

The library has been evaluated with a set of key accelerators from emerging application domains. MemLuv delivers significant gains in FPGA's accelerators density, i.e. 3.8 × , and application throughput up to 3.1 × and 21.4 × for shared and private memory accelerators.

For any questions/suggestions/bug reporting you may contact MemLuv's source code main author Dionysios Diamantopoulos at "dionisios.diamantopoulos@REMOVETHIS gmail.com" .

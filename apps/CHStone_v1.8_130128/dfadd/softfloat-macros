|    1. This source code is modified to unify the formats of the benchmark |
|       programs in CHStone.                                               |
|    2. Test vectors are added for CHStone.                                |
|    3. If "main_result" is 0 at the end of the program, the program is    |
|       correctly executed.                                                |
|    4. Please follow the copyright of each benchmark program.             |

Arithmetic Package, Release 2b.

Written by John R. Hauser.  This work was made possible in part by the
International Computer Science Institute, located at Suite 600, 1947 Center
Street, Berkeley, California 94704.  Funding was partially provided by the
National Science Foundation under grant MIP-9311980.  The original version
of this code was written as part of a project to build a fixed-point vector
processor in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley,
overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and John Wawrzynek.  More information
